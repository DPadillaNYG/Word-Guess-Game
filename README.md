# Word Guess Game
A word guess game using skills learned in JavaScript.

### Assignment
I was tasked with having to make a word guess game with no direction using only 
*vanilla JavaScript* to record user guesses, to keep track of letters guessed, 
to give the user a set amount of guesses to get the word right, to record wins, 
and to incorporate my personality into the project. 

### Skills Learned
I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife 
who is also a very talented programmer and utilizing Google-Fu. Here are some things
I learned on the fly:

* .join()
* .slice()
* .then()
* .sort()

**Also refer to comments within game.js to see how I utilized:**
* functions
* global variables
* local variables
* flag variables
* for loops
* nested ifs
* arrays
* onkeyup events
