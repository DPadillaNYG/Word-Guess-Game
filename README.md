### Assignment

I was tasked with having to make a word guess game with no direction using only
_vanilla JavaScript_ to record user guesses, to keep track of letters guessed,
to give the user a set amount of guesses to get the word right, to record wins,
and to incorporate my personality into the project.

### Skills Learned

I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife
who is also a very talented programmer and utilizing Google-Fu. Here are some things
I learned on the fly:

- .join()
- .slice()
- .splice()
- .then()
- .sort()

**Also, feel free to refer to the comments within game.js to see how I utilized:**

- functions
- global variables
- local variables
- flag variables
- for loops
- nested ifs
- arrays
- onkeyup events
